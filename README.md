<h1 align="left">Trivia Game</h1>

###

<p align="left">This project aimed to create a game that used questions from an API and, with each hit, a value was scored on its scoreboard based on the difficulty of the question and the time in which the question was answered. It was also possible for the user to be free to choose the category, difficulty and type of questions. In addition, the game has a ranking system, that is, every time someone logs in, a new user is created, with the ranking organized in descending order according to the score.</p>
